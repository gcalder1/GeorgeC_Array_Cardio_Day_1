    // Array.prototype.filter()
    // 1. Filter the list of inventors for those who were born in the 1500's
    
    const fifteen = inventors.filter(inventor => (inventor.year >= 1500 && inventor.year < 1600))
    
    //using arrow function to write in one line - returns boolean value of true
    //in the same way
    
    console.table(fifteen);

    /* +++++My Notes: .filter()+++++
    
    The filter method can be used to return a shallow copy of your data
    with the elements from the original array that return truthy based on the
    condition referenced. The reason this could be useful is because it can
    ignore elements that do NOT meet the requirements of the condition used 
    as the filter, therefore allowing us to have a stored, shallow copy of that
    new array. 
    
    If we were to edit the original array, the filtered array would
    then reflect those changes since the shallow copy is copying the original
    elements that return truthy for your condition of your filter. 
    
    And because the elements that return as truthy will be stored within that new shallow
    copy of the array, if we were to console.log (or console table for arrays
    that have objects) that array, we would only those same values that return
    as truthy and not the original array.

    // Array.prototype.map()
    // 2. Give us an array of the inventors first and last names

    const fullNames = inventors.map(inventor => `${inventor.first} ${inventor.last}`);
    console.log(fullNames);
    // console.table(fullNames); <- MAkes info easier to see

    /* +++++My notes: .map()+++++

    .map() is a method that iterates through each object within an array and
    applies whatever function was declared for it. The result from this is
    a new array in the form of a shallow copy based on the original array,
    where the objects within the new array have been altered by whatever
    function was declared within the method's function call. The amout of
    objects returned will always be the same amount of objects as in the
    original array because it is a shallow copy after all does not affect
    the original array in the first place (does not mutate OG array).

    // Array.prototype.sort()
    // 3. Sort the inventors by birthdate, oldest to youngest

    // const ordered = inventors.sort(function(firstPerson, secondPerson) {
    //   if (firstPerson.year > secondPerson.year) {
    //     return 1; //because firstPerson would return a 1, this would make it
    //     //less than, therefore allowing first person to appear after. 
    //   } else {
    //     return -1; //because first person would return a -1 instead, this
    //     //would make a less than b therefore allowing first-person to 
    //     //appear before since the method checks against 0.
    //   }
    // });

    const ordered = inventors.sort((firstPerson, secondPerson) => firstPerson.year > secondPerson.year ? 1 : -1);

    console.table(ordered);

    /* +++++My notes: .sort()+++++
    .sort() applies changes to the original data structure based on the
    function called. This means that it does not use a copy of the data.
    Since it is using the OG array's elements, then any changes would affect
    other things that would make copies of the OG's array's data set.

    .sort() organizes based on what criteria the method of the function you 
    provide has when called. Based on what the function finds is true, then
    that will determine the order of said array elements.

    (e.g: 
    
    if a > b -> return 1; means that a will go after b in the newly sorted array
    
    if a < b -> return -1; means that a will go before b in the newly sorted array
    
    if a === b -> return 0; means that no order change will occur

    If no function was declared, then a few things could happen. If the
    array's elements were numbers, then they'll just be sorted numerically. 
    If they were strings, then the array would be sorted based on their 
    unicode values. The .sort() has some default stuff it relies on incase
    something like this would happen.

    // 5. Sort the inventors by years lived

    // 6. create a list of Boulevards in Paris that contain 'de' anywhere in the name
    // https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Boulevards_in_Paris


    // 7. sort Exercise
    // Sort the people alphabetically by last name

    // 8. Reduce Exercise
    // Sum up the instances of each of these
